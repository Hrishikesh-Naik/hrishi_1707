    <h2>Brillio</h2>
    <p>
        Brillio was formed in 2014 when Collabera, a global IT recruiting and staffing company firm based out of Morristown,
         New Jersey spun off its IT services division into the subsidiary company, Brillio. 
         The goal was for Brillio to become a standalone entity by the end of that year. 
         In April 2015, Brillio legally incorporated as its own entity under "Brillio Holdings, Inc." in New Castle County, Delaware.
